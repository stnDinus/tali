              not currently meet the eye. In part, this is the consequence of
              measurement difficulties. Practitioners and researchers can benefit
              from an understanding of the “dimensionality” of the maintenance
              problem. Some measures are suggested for coming to grips with this
              dimensionality, and problems of utilization associated with these
              measures are explored.},
